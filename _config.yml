      When I'm not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as mountain biking, road cycling, cooking and watching F1 as well as trying to make time for things like Hiking and playing some cricket. I currently have 2 dogs and find this is a great way to get out of the house and taking my mind of things while learing to showjump.
      I'm interested in autocross, cycling, Tifosi and badminton, this is mainly through sport but I enjoy Creating websites and abstract photography too. My work on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hathwarkoushik/">Instagram</a> if you would like to take a look - hathwarkoushik.
      Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me cruising down the streets on my trusty two-wheeled steeds (joking üòÑ) or down 'The Rec' supporting GSW.
