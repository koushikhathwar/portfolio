            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.

      When I’m not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and horse riding as well as trying to make time for things like rock climbing and playing some rugby. I currently have 2 horses and find this is a great way to get out of the house and taking my mind of things while learing to showjump.
      I’m interested in cycling, Tifosi and badminton, this is mainly through sport but I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on instagram if you would like to take a look - hathwarkoushik.
      Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes, rock climbing at one of Bristol’s indoor climbing centres or down ‘The Rec’ supporting NBA.
